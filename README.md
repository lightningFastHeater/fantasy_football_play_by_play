# NFL Fantasy Football Point Tracker

A web tool I built to help understand how fantasy football scoring works.

## Why I Made This
I manage a fantasy team and compete against my friends every week. We're always checking scores and debating trades. I thought it would be fun to build my own web app that shows exactly how fantasy points happen during real NFL games.

## What It Does
You can see fantasy points happening in real NFL games. See which plays are worth points, how yards add up, and track your favorite players. The tool shows all current and past games using ESPN's API, calculates points for each play, and gives running totals.

## Using It
Pick any NFL week and click a game. You'll see every play that earned fantasy points and how they were scored. The important plays show up in different colors so they're easy to spot.
